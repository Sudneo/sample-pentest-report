	\section{Disclaimer}
	A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time.  The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.\\
	Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. \pentesterShort\ prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. \pentesterShort\  recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

	\section{Assessment Overview}
	From May 20th, 2019 to May 29th, 2019, \pentesterShort\ engaged \companyNameShort\ to evaluate the security posture of its infrastructure compared to current industry best practices that included an external penetration test.  All testing performed is based on the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks. 
Phases of penetration testing activities include the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Planning – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
	\item  Discovery – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
	\item Attack – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
	\item Reporting – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Assessment Components}
	\label{sec:assessment_components}
	External Penetration Test

	An external penetration test emulates the role of an attacker attempting to gain access to an internal network without internal resources or inside knowledge.  A \pentesterShort engineer attempts to gather sensitive information through open-source intelligence (OSINT), including employee information, historical breached passwords, and more that can be leveraged against external systems to gain internal network access.  The engineer also performs scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities in hopes of exploitation.

	\section{Executive Summary}%
	\label{sec:executive_summary}
	
	\pentesterShort\ evaluated \companyNameShort’s external security posture through an external network penetration test from May 20th, 2019 to May 29th, 2019.  By leveraging a series of attacks, \pentesterShort\ found critical level vulnerabilities that allowed full internal network access to the \companyNameShort\ headquarter office.  It is highly recommended that \companyNameShort\ address these vulnerabilities as soon as possible as the vulnerabilities are easily found through basic reconnaissance and exploitable without much effort.

	\pentesterShort\ gathered historical breached data found in credentials dumps.  The data amounted to 868 total account credentials (Note: A full list of compromised accounts can be found in “Demo Company-867-19 Full Findings.xslx”.).	

	\pentesterShort\ used the gathered credentials to perform a credential stuffing attack against the OWA login page.  Credential stuffing attacks take previously known credentials and attempt to use them on login forms to gain access to company resources.  \pentesterShort\ was unsuccessful in the attack but was able to gather additional sensitive information from the OWA server in the form of username enumeration.
