# Penetration Testing Template

This is a template I am compiling together in preparation for the eCPPT exam.

The content is mostly taken from [TCM's Report](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report) and some cosmetic changes are added.

## Motivation

The reasons why I wanted to convert the template in LaTeX are:

* I find LaTeX formatting to be stable and with it there is no need to mess with a WYSIWYG editor, dragging tables etc.
* I can integrate it with Vim for a more productive experience.

## Content of the Repo

This repository contains:

* The LaTeX source code and corresponding images for the report
* Vim snippets I used to automate some parts, in particular, the sections about the findings.

## Vim

The idea of this template is that the main part will be fairly constant across engagements, while the part that changes the most (findings) should be smooth to write.
For this reason, the plan is to use Vim with Ultisnips, to generate table for findings in a very quick way, with pre-filled options and structure.

## How to Use

To get started, just clone this repo and add the content of `snippets.vim` to your custom snippets file or to your LaTeX filetype snippets.

### Variables and definitions

The LaTeX code should be straightforward and commented, but it's worth mentioning that you can customize the look using the following definitions:


```
% Name of the Company
\newcommand{\companyName}{Company Name}
% Shortened name of the company (use \companyName if full name should be used)
\newcommand{\companyNameShort}{CN}
% Name of the document
\newcommand{\reportName}{Security Assessment Finding Report}
% Name of pentesting company
\newcommand{\pentester}{Sudneo Security}
% Shortened name of the pentesting company (use \pentester if full name should be used)
\newcommand{\pentesterShort}{SSec}
% URL of pentesting company
\newcommand{\pentesterSite}{\url{https://coolbyte.eu}}
```

Also, all the images in the `images` directory can be referenced directly.

Finally, if you want to change the colors used, please change them in the header to maintain a consistent look:

```
\definecolor{link-blue}{RGB}{6,69,173}
\definecolor{dark-green}{RGB}{52,133,62}
\definecolor{light-blue}{RGB}{127, 180, 240}
\definecolor{dark-blue}{RGB}{72, 120, 224}
\definecolor{heading-grey}{RGB}{181, 185, 189}
\definecolor{Critical}{RGB}{173, 35, 10}
\definecolor{High}{RGB}{224, 133, 47}
\definecolor{Moderate}{RGB}{237, 199, 7}
\definecolor{Low}{RGB}{93,186,105}
\definecolor{Informational}{RGB}{78, 142, 245}
```
