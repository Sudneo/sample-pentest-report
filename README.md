# Penetration Testing Template

This is a template I am compiling together in preparation for the eCPPT exam.

The content is mostly taken from [TCM's Report](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report).

## Motivation

The reasons why I wanted to convert the template in LaTeX are:

* I find LaTeX formatting to be stable and doesn't require me time to mess with a WYSIWYG editor, dragging tables etc.
* I can integrate it with Vim.

## Content of the Repo

This repository will contain:

* The LaTeX source code and corresponding images
* Vim snippets to write faster

## Vim

The idea of this template is that the main part will be fairly constant across engagements, while the part that changes the most (findings) should be smooth to write.
For this reason, the plan is to use Vim with Ultisnips, to generate table for findings in a very quick way, with pre-filled options and structure.
